# Etch-A-Sketch
This is the Etch-A-Sketch assignment from The Odin Project.

The default state of the board is a 16x16 grid with the Normal draw mode. You can choose among 3 draw modes, Normal, Darken, and Random.

To draw, just hover the mouse over the grid.

Normal mode will draw each pixel with a solid color like an Etch-A-Sketch.
Darken mode will draw each pixel in a light gray color and subsequent visits to that pixel will color it in darker.
Random mode will color in each pixel a random color each time it is visited.

The reset button will clear the board and prompt you to choose a grid size. It defaults to 16x16 but you can go as high as 100, and as low as 1.

The clear button will clear the board without prompting you for a new grid size.
